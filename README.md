## Data

The data from this project will be coming from 2 sources.  The first source is the dbpedia website at the following address: http://wiki.dbpedia.org/downloads-2016-04.  From this website, we will use the following files:
1. english skos categories file (with the ttl extension) - used to construct a graph of the connections between Wikipedia category pages
2. english redirects file (with the ttl extension) - used to get all titles of each article
3. article categories file (with the ttl extension) - used to get link the articles to their categories
The second source is the version of wikipedia stored at JHU CLSP in the concrete format (see http://hltcoe.github.io).
